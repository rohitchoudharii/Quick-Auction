		<desc>"I just closed my first auction with QuickAuction and it was an incredibly smooth experience. They made me feel comfortable with selling some of the many items my family collected over the years and we got best price and in a timely manner as well. Whether you have a large storage full of items or just handful of pieces, I highly recommend them for your auction needs."</desc>
